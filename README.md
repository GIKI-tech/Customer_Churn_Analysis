# Customer Churn Prediction in E-commerce

We are going to use the Brazilian [E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) to predict customer churn.

The data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. 

First, we merged all the datasets and calculated some new indicators that would facilitate our work  such as order_purchase_year, order_purchase_month, order_purchase_dayofweek, order_purchase_hour, year_month, ship_duration, tocarrier_duration, lastmile_duration, expected_vs_shipdate, expected_duration
Then we dropped the missing values.
